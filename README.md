# Memento

Memento is designed and implemented by Nevzat Acar and Berk Gökçayoğlu.

This project must be started from the workspace.

We couldn't implement search for hashtags and location because of the high workload of the project. Handling different threads challenged us the most.
There is also a little problem with going from profile to the note screen after changing the photo. Even though everything works smoothly, the profile photo might not change at the first time and some time will change it. We also haven't implemented the no network connection because of the wide scope.

We recommend you to create two different profile and look for the functionalities afterwards.

Thank you,
Nevzat Acar
